# monodepth-estimation

Real time monocular depth estimation using MiDas (Mixing Datasets for Zero-shot Cross-dataset Transfer). 
This small project makes use of your webcam in a real time fashion, showing whatever you want on the webcam alongside the generated depth maps. 
It is used on various applications, including the familiar `smartphone camera function` that blurs distant background images when taking a picture, 
detecting nearby objects for `self-driving vehicles`, `3D reconstruction objects` and so on.
