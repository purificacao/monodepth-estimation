# Monocular Depth Estimation

Depth estimation techniques are used on various applications, including the familiar `smartphone camera function` that blurs distant background images when taking a picture, detecting nearby objects for `self-driving vehicles`, `3D reconstruction objects` and so on. This project enables you to access real time monocular depth estimation from your webcam device using MiDas (Mixing Datasets for Zero-shot Cross-dataset Transfer). It shows the results in real time fashion, exhibiting whatever you want on the webcam alongside the generated depth maps. 


## Requirements

 - OpenCV 4.6.0 (I haven't tried this code on any other versions)
